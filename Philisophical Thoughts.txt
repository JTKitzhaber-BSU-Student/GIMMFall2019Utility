One of the games I have played that involve philisopical ideas is Dishonored. In the beginning of the game you are told to escape the prison, the only other information is waypoints of a route out. It is up to you the player to decide if you are going to slaughter your way out of the prison or not be seen by anyone. This choice, from a game is rather interesting as the game doesn't tell you that there is the option of non-lethality.
